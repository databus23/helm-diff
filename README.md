This is a Helm plugin giving your a preview of what a `helm upgrade` would change.
It basically generates a diff between the latest deployed version of a release
and a `helm upgrade --debug --dry-run`. This can also be used to compare two 
revisions/versions of your helm release.

## Install

### Using Helm plugin manager (> 2.3.x)

```shell
helm plugin install https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff
```

### Pre Helm 2.3.0 Installation
Pick a release tarball from the [releases](https://github.com/databus23/helm-diff/releases) page.

Unpack the tarball in your helm plugins directory (`$(helm home)/plugins`).

E.g.
```
curl -L $TARBALL_URL | tar -C $(helm home)/plugins -xzv
```

### From Source
#### Prerequisites
 - GoLang `>= 1.17`

Make sure you do not have a verison of `helm-diff` installed. You can remove it by running `helm plugin uninstall diff`

#### Installation Steps
The first step is to download the repository and enter the directory. You can do this via `git clone` or downloaing and extracting the release. If you clone via git, remember to checkout the latest tag for the latest release.

Next, depending on which helm version you have, install the plugin into helm.

##### Helm 2
```bash
make install
```

##### Helm 3
```bash
make install/helm3
```


## Usage

```
The Helm Diff Plugin

* Shows a diff explaining what a helm upgrade would change:
    This fetches the currently deployed version of a release
  and compares it to a local chart plus values. This can be 
  used visualize what changes a helm upgrade will perform.

* Shows a diff explaining what had changed between two revisions:
    This fetches previously deployed versions of a release
  and compares them. This can be used visualize what changes 
  were made during revision change.

* Shows a diff explaining what a helm rollback would change:
    This fetches the currently deployed version of a release
  and compares it to the previously deployed version of the release, that you
  want to rollback. This can be used visualize what changes a 
  helm rollback will perform.

Usage:
  diff [flags]
  diff [command]

Available Commands:
  release     Shows diff between release's manifests
  revision    Shows diff between revision's manifests
  rollback    Show a diff explaining what a helm rollback could perform
  upgrade     Show a diff explaining what a helm upgrade would change.
  version     Show version of the helm diff plugin

Flags:
      --allow-unreleased             enables diffing of releases that are not yet deployed via Helm
  -a, --api-versions stringArray     Kubernetes api versions used for Capabilities.APIVersions
      --color                        color output. You can control the value for this flag via HELM_DIFF_COLOR=[true|false]. If both --no-color and --color are unspecified, coloring enabled only when the stdout is a term and TERM is not "dumb"
  -C, --context int                  output NUM lines of context around changes (default -1)
      --detailed-exitcode            return a non-zero exit code when there are changes
      --devel                        use development versions, too. Equivalent to version '>0.0.0-0'. If --version is set, this is ignored.
      --disable-openapi-validation   disables rendered templates validation against the Kubernetes OpenAPI Schema
      --disable-validation           disables rendered templates validation against the Kubernetes cluster you are currently pointing to. This is the same validation performed on an install
      --dry-run                      disables cluster access and show diff as if it was install. Implies --install, --reset-values, and --disable-validation
  -h, --help                         help for diff
      --include-tests                enable the diffing of the helm test hooks
      --install                      enables diffing of releases that are not yet deployed via Helm (equivalent to --allow-unreleased, added to match "helm upgrade --install" command
      --kubeconfig string            This flag is ignored, to allow passing of this top level flag to helm

      --no-hooks                     disable diffing of hooks
      --normalize-manifests          normalize manifests before running diff to exclude style differences from the output
      --output string                Possible values: diff, simple, json, template. When set to "template", use the env var HELM_DIFF_TPL to specify the template. (default "diff")
      --post-renderer string         the path to an executable to be used for post rendering. If it exists in $PATH, the binary will be used, otherwise it will try to look for the executable at the given path

      --reset-values                 reset the values to the ones built into the chart and merge in any new values
      --reuse-values                 reuse the last release's values and merge in any new values. If '--reset-values' is specified, this is ignored

## Commands:

### upgrade:

```
$ helm diff upgrade -h
Show a diff explaining what a helm upgrade would change.

This fetches the currently deployed version of a release
and compares it to a chart plus values.
This can be used visualize what changes a helm upgrade will
perform.

Examples:
  helm diff upgrade my-release stable/postgresql --values values.yaml

  # Set HELM_DIFF_IGNORE_UNKNOWN_FLAGS=true to ignore unknown flags
